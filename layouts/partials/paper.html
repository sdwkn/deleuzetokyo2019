Deleuze / Guattari Studies in Asia: 7th International Conference, Tokyo, 2019
21-23 June 2019, University of Tokyo Komaba Campus, 3-8-1, Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, JAPAN
</p>

<h4>THEME: War Machine, Conflict, Coexistence</h4>

<p>
The theme for the conference is ‘War Machine, Conflict, Coexistence’. Why? Because we live in a world where the concept ‘war machine’ has now become so miserably commonplace and anodyne. The cooptation and recuperation of the concept by the naysayers of reason threaten to deradicalize Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy. How? In two respects: 1) the contemporary globalized form of capitalism has overwhelmed national economies and; 2) terrorism has replaced traditional forms of state-war. As such, conflicts are pervasive on a global scale yet often elude traditional social, political and economic schematics.
</p>

<p>
In the play of perceptible and imperceptible, how should or can we coexist in such a world? What does it mean to think the world and coexistence within it. Are we without a world? Are we embroiled within toxic relations of an unworld. How does the work of Deleuze and Guattari assist this new relation? The conference aims to answer this question. Yet one problem arises. As the idea of coexistence is not explicitly explored in their philosophy, how can we respond to this conspicuous lacuna? Given this bottleneck of reason, it is exceedingly timely to think contemporary geo-political problems and ideas from the perspective of Deleuze and/or Guattari. Our task is to begin thinking again; to shed a dogmatic image of thought and to inspire a new comportment to the world. Given this crisis and amid such devastating conflict, we are asking conference delegates to think about the concept of coexistence in a specifically Deleuzian and Guattarian way. We are in search for nothing less than a new paradigm or image of thought. ​
